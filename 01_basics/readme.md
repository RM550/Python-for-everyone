## ✨ Python Basics

### 📍 1. Printing Output 🖨️
To display text or numbers, use the `print()` function:
```python
print("Hello, World! 🌎")
```

### 📍 2. Variables 📦
Variables store data values:
```python
name = "Reyan"
age = 16
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

### 📍 3. Data Types 🔢🔠
Python has different data types:
- **Integer** (`int`): `10, 20, 100`
- **Float** (`float`): `10.5, 20.75`
- **String** (`str`): `'Hello'`, `"World"`
- **Boolean** (`bool`): `True`, `False`
- **List** (`list`): `[1, 2, 3]`
- **Tuple** (`tuple`): `(1, 2, 3)`
- **Dictionary** (`dict`): `{ "name": "Reyan", "age": 16 }`

### 📍 4. Taking User Input ⌨️
You can take input from the user using `input()`:
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}! 👋")
```

### 📍 5. Conditional Statements 🤔
Control the flow of your program with `if`, `elif`, and `else`:
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult. ✅")
elif age > 12:
    print("You are a teenager. 🤘")
else:
    print("You are a kid. 🎈")
```

### 📍 6. Loops 🔁
Loops help execute code multiple times:

**For Loop:**
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Iteration {i} 🔄")
```

**While Loop:**
```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(f"Number: {x} 📊")
    x += 1
```

### 📍 7. Functions 🛠️
Functions help in reusing code:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}! 😊"

print(greet("Reyan"))
```
