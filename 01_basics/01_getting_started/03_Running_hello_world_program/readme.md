# 🚀 Running a "Hello, World!" Program in Python using VSCode

## 📌 Prerequisites
Before running a Python program in **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**, ensure you have the following installed:

✅ **[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)** – A powerful code editor for multiple languages.  
✅ **[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** – A programming language required to run Python scripts.  
   ➡️ During installation, check the option **Add Python to PATH** to avoid command-line issues.

## 🔧 Step 1: Install the Python Extension in VSCode
To execute Python scripts seamlessly in VSCode, install the Python extension:

1️⃣ Open **VSCode**.  
2️⃣ Click on the **Extensions** icon 🧩 on the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).  
3️⃣ In the search bar, type **Python**.  
4️⃣ Select the extension provided by **Microsoft** (with a blue icon) and click **Install**.  
5️⃣ After installation, **restart VSCode** to ensure everything is set up properly. 🔄

## 📄 Step 2: Create a Python File
1️⃣ Open **VSCode**.  
2️⃣ Click on **File > New File** or press `Ctrl+N` to create a new file.  
3️⃣ Click **File > Save As**, name the file **hello_world.py**, and ensure the `.py` extension is used.  
4️⃣ Type the following Python code inside the file:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World! 👋")
   ```
5️⃣ Save the file using `Ctrl+S`. 💾

## ▶️ Step 3: Run the Python Program
### 🔹 Method 1: Using the VSCode Run Button
1️⃣ Open the `hello_world.py` file in VSCode.  
2️⃣ Click the **Run** button (▶) at the top-right corner of the editor.  
3️⃣ The **Terminal** will open automatically, and you should see this output:
   ```
   Hello, World! 👋
   ```

### 🔹 Method 2: Using the Integrated Terminal
1️⃣ Open the file in VSCode.  
2️⃣ Open the terminal by pressing **``Ctrl+` ``** or navigating to **Terminal > New Terminal**.  
3️⃣ In the terminal, type:
   ```sh
   python hello_world.py
   ```
   (For macOS/Linux users, you may need to use `python3 hello_world.py` instead.)  
4️⃣ Press `Enter` ⏎, and you should see the output:
   ```
   Hello, World! 👋
   ```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
⚠️ **Issue: "Python not recognized" error?**  
➡️ Ensure Python is installed and added to PATH during installation. Restart your computer if needed.  
➡️ Check Python installation by running `python --version` in the terminal.

⚠️ **No output or errors?**  
➡️ Ensure the file is saved correctly with a `.py` extension.  
➡️ Double-check your code for typos (e.g., `print("Hello, World! 👋")`).  

## 🎯 Conclusion
Congratulations! 🎊 You have successfully set up **VSCode** and run your first **Python program**. 🚀

Happy Coding! 💻😊
